connecting the app to google photos in order to access the entire google photots folder didnt work out, google has increased the strictness of their permissions

then we tried rclone, which is a third party app to read-only google photos, which was also blocked by google

now the last option, we will be trying to download the entire google photos folder to local using google takeout and then run our app. lol
this one worked!

now i got all my pictures and metadata in the images folder
